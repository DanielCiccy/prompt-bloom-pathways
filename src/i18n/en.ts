    title: "üèÜ Why 'Prompt Renfort'?",
    intro: `Prompt Renfort is a French term from classical theatre: it appears in <b>Le Cid</b> by Pierre Corneille (17th century) and literally means ‚Äúsudden reinforcement,‚Äù a decisive support that arises at a moment of doubt or wounded honor.

In the play, Don Rodrigue is summoned by his father to show courage in a moral dilemma. ‚ÄúPrompt renfort‚Äù designates the surge of inner strength‚Äîa moral resolve‚Äîthat allows one to act nobly.

<b>This is exactly what our AI does:</b>`,
    values: [
      "It does not replace the student. It provides support.",
      "It does not command. It invites.",
      "It is not a machine for answers. It is a symbolic preceptor.",
    ],
    conclusion: `Prompt Renfort accompanies the student when doubt creeps in, when facing the blank page, or trying to rephrase understanding.

We chose to keep the name in French.
Because language carries memory.
Because a brand can also be a verse.
Because learning is not a solitary act‚Äîlearning is an act of will.

Like in the play, Prompt Renfort does not act in place of the student.
It appears when courage is needed.
It arrives when knowledge seeks to take root.`,
